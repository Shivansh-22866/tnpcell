            The Training and Placement Cell (T&P) of the institute is endowed
            with the responsibility to cater to the training and placement needs
            of its elite students. Run and managed by an efficient team of
            professors, office staff, and students, the T&P cell handles all
            aspects of placement/internship at NIT Goa. It invites companies for
            campus recruitment, organizing pre- placement talks, interviews, and
            corporate interaction. Under the Training and Placement Cell, an
            efficient team mentors the aspiring students to enhance their
            technical, interpersonal, managerial, and leadership skills with
            soft-skill development programs, mock interviews, and tests. It
            helps the students to plan their professional careers and groom
            themselves with the skill set demanded by the industry. The training
            and placement cell gives exposure and opportunity to companies and
            students by assisting them in conducting lecture talks, tests,
            competitions, and interviews. Our students have done internships in
            industries and universities. This exposure to real-world situations
            makes the students more confident in making independent decisions.
            Many students become aware of internship and research opportunities
            in India and abroad. Many industries provide Pre-Placement Offers
            (PPOs) based on studentsâ€™ performance during the internship period.
            It is commendable that the National Institute of Technology Goa has
            seen engineers budding exceptionally well during Summer and Winter
            Vacations, not only in Indian and foreign universities but also
            reputed companies as well (both on and off-campus). We help build
            and sustain relations with companies, universities, and social
            organizations that wish to recruit students for internships and
            research opportunities.
